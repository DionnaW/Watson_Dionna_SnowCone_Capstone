Okay this is the first and last time that I will restart the project! I've installed React, react-router-dom and will have this design done by end of class today, hopefully!
My plan for this is to have a full frontend implemented and styled using css, html, react, js, and typescript!
App is running!
I moved, deleted, changed AS LOT of things so my app is not rumnning right now, but i need a break so i'll commit for the sake of it.
I finally have my frontend functioning! What a success!!! GOOD NIGHT FOR TONIGHT
ALL FUNCTIONALITY ON THE FRONT END IS WORKING!!! I just need to style and connect backend 
Forntend is not rendering backend data...
Completed backend to frontend for toppings and styling!
Flavors frontend/backend connection successful!
Calendar complete!
All pages are complete!
